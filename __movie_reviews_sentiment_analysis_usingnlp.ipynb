But there's a Very unique element to it all even Vijay looks a totally different person embodying the character.. I didn't like any of the Atlee movies. sure they were entertaining in patches but were not great at all.master on the contrary might not be celebrated as those movies but in time fans will appreciate it, and the harsh realities it showcases about the life of under age people in the crime, how they are exploited and the things and people who influence their lifes. Overall it was a great watch many might not like it and it's not perfect but in time it'll get the recognition it deserves. And one more thing Vijay sethubathi was fantastic!!!</div>\n",
